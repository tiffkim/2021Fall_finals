###  Overview:
We want to investigate the impact of global temperature change in production of agricultural goods. Due to global warming, agriculture and food security have become a new concern. Our data analysis will look into the relationships between global temperature change and agriculture and food security. The data analysis will look at it from different angles: seasonal impact, regional impact, and crop type, etc.
