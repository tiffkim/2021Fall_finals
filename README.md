###  Overview:
Past decades, we have witnessed many unusual "record breaking" natural disasters that not only destroyed our habitats, but also the habitats of other species. Scientists have proved the link between greenhouse gas and global warming. Humans are responsible for the cause of global warming and we are witnessing the impact through [climate change](https://stacker.com/stories/3377/natural-disasters-linked-climate-change). We hear news that some countries are [sinking](https://www.activesustainability.com/climate-change/countries-risk-disappearing-climate-change/?_adin=02021864894) and some of us are experiencing the magnitude of global warming more than others. Based on general news we see, the countries who are most impacted by global warming does not seemed to be the ones who were most responsible for it. We wanted to investigate which countries are most responsible for global warming and see if the most responsible ones are experiencing the temeperature increase.

With our research background, we have developed two hypotheses to test using the data analysis.
### Hypothesis
Hypothesis #1: Countries closer to the equator experience higher average temperature increase than the countries 
farther from the equator in the past 50 years.  (In percentage )
Datasets needed: latitude and longitude library, country map, country temperatures

Hypothesis #2: Countries with ascending GDP and population have growing CO2 emission per capita than
countries with descending GDP and population.
Datasets needed: GDP, population, CO2 emission by countries

### Data Sets
- [temperature data by year and city](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)

- [city locations with ASCII name](https://www.kaggle.com/swapnilbhange/average-temperature-of-cities)

Datasets for hypothesis #2
- [world GDP growth by country in percentage](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?end=2020&start=1961&view=chart)

- [world Population by country](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/)

- [Per capita CO2 emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/per-capita-co2)
