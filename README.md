###  Overview:
We want to investigate the impact of global temperature change in production of agricultural goods. Due to global warming, agriculture and food security have become a new concern. Our data analysis will look into the relationships between global temperature change and agriculture and food security. The data analysis will look at it from different angles: seasonal impact, regional impact, and crop type, etc.

### Hypothesis
Hypothesis #1: Countries closer to the equator experience higher average temperature increase than the countries 
farther from the equator in the past 50 years.  (In percentage )
Datasets needed: latitude and longitude library, country map, country temperatures

Hypothesis #2: Countries with ascending GDP and population in the past 30 years emit higher CO2 per capita than 
countries with descending GDP.
Datasets needed: GDP, population, CO2 emission by countries
